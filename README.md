A game that allows users to participate in a short archery tournament where they are able to control the angle and power of the bow. There are two types of play. The first type would be a timed game play where the user can shoot to score as many points as they can. There are a total of 3 levels and each level will have different challenges. The first level would be basic stationary targets and a standard time of around 1 minute. The second level would be moving targets with a standard time of around 1 minute. The last level would be moving targets and obstacles such as wind and falling objects. The second type of game play would be playing against the computer. The player would do about 2-3 rounds against the computer in the 3 level environments.
